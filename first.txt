hello till now i learned:
1) init to make a repo or current working directory
2) rm -rf .git to undo init
3) mkdir to make a new folder
4) touch fileName.extension to create a new file
5) git add . here "." means all the files in current folder or directory
	you can also do git add fileName.extension
	add means to make the file to go from directory to staging area so u can commit
6) vi fileName.extension to open the file
	to exit vi press esc then type  :x where --INSERT-- is written
7) Never commit in the main branch
   git branch branchName: to create new branch
   git checkout branchName :to enter in the branchName
8) git status:to check in which state(directory(Red) or staging area(green)) the file is
	or to tell whether the files are ready to commit or not
9) git diff means what is the difference between the committed one and current one
